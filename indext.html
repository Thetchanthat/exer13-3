            Angkor Wat is the prime example of the classical style of Khmer 
            architecture—the Angkor Wat style—to which it has given its name. 
            By the 12th century, Khmer architects had become skilled and confident
             in the use of sandstone (rather than brick or laterite) as the main
              building material. Most of the 
            visible areas are sandstone blocks, while laterite was used for
             the outer wall and hidden structural parts. The binding agent
              used to join the blocks is yet to be identified, although 
              natural resins or slaked lime has been suggested.
              The temple has drawn praise above all for the harmony
               of its design. According to Maurice Glaize, a mid-20th-century 
               conservator of Angkor, the temple "attains a classic perfection 
               by the restrained monumentality of its finely balanced elements 
               and the precise arrangement of its proportions. It is a work of
                power, unity, and style.
