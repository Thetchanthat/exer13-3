                Angkor Wat is the prime example of the classical style of 
                Khmer architecture—the Angkor Wat style—to which it has 
                given its name. By the 12th century, Khmer architects had 
                become skilled and confident in the use of sandstone 
                (rather than brick or laterite) as the main building material.
                Most of the visible areas are sandstone blocks, while 
                laterite was used for the outer wall and hidden structural 
                parts. The binding agent used to join the blocks is yet to be 
                identified, although natural resins or slaked lime has been 
                suggested.
